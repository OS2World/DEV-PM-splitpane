<h2>Using the splitpane control in your programs</h2>
The first thing to do in order to use a splitpane control in your
application is to register its class.<br>
<div class="prototype">
rc = <a href="reg.html">WinSplitPaneRegister</a>(hab);

</div>
Then you can load a dialog template containing <span class="spltkwd">WC_SPLITPANE</span>
<span class="os2kwd">CONTROL</span> statements or
use <span class="relevant">WinCreateWindow()</span> to
create the splitpane and its
two child windows within the client of a standard window.<br>
<p>It should be noticed that, due to the PM
programming interface, in the current splitpane implementation, the
child panes are not real child windows but a sort of virtual ones. They
are just splitpane siblings whose position, size and visibility is
controlled by the splitpane as if it were their real parent, so they
must be created separately and then a PM message must be sent to the
splitpane to notify it the handles of the sibling windows it must
control.
