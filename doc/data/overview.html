<h2>Overview</h2>
A splitpane control displays two child windows side by side (or one on
top of the other). The space between the two child windows is occupied
by a splitter which can be dragged to change the sizes of the two
windows at its sides.<br>
Splitpane controls can be nested to divide a window in more than two
areas.
<p>A pattern, painted over the splitter, shows the user that
it is an interactive area, not just plain dialog background.</p>
<p>As the mouse pointer is moved over the splitter its shape changes to
show that the splitter can be moved horizontally (or vertically if it
is an horizontal splitter).
<h2><a name="userint">User interaction</a></h2>
In most similar splitpane controls, a splitter can
be dragged only via the mouse, while in this splitpane implementation a
splitter can respond to keyboard events as well.
<p>To be able to recognize keyboard events the splitpane must first
acquire the input focus. Unlikely most other controls it does not
acquire the focus when a mouse button is clicked over it (the user can
still drag it around with the mouse, without stealing the focus from
other controls), but only when the user is already using the keyboard
and switches the focus among the various controls by the TAB key.</p>

<p>As soon as the splitter gets the input focus, the
pattern changes from a two colors 3D one to a single color
(usually the foreground color).</p>

<p>The direction keys are used to move the splitter in steps as long as
the splitter thickness.<br>
The Page-up/down keys reduce the widths of one of the two panes to its
minimum (by default zero pixels).<br>
The Home/End keys completely hide one of the side areas (if the current
splitpane style allows that).<br>

<p>The splitpane control optionally allows to
immediately hide and restore one of its side panes. In this case the
splitter includes a clickable area with two triangle shaped arrows.<br>
The mouse pointer shape switches to the default when the mouse is moved
over the clickable area.<br>
Once the left mouse button is pressed over an arrow, the color changes
to provide a visible feedback of the event. Then if the mouse button is
released over the arrow the corresponding pane is collapsed while the
other pane occupies the whole area and the just clicked arrow takes a
different color to display its disabled state.<br>
A collapsed pane can be restored by a click on the enabled arrow or
just by dragging it to any other position.<br>
