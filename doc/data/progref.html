<h2>WC_SPLITPANE programming reference</h2>
The splitpane control fully respects the PM control standards.<br>
Both its
look and its behaviour can be easily changed via presentation
parameters or
the control specific styles, while the <a href="ctldata.html">SPLITCTLDATA</a>
data structure allows
full control on its initial values on window creation or in dialog
scripts.
<p>Besides that, a rich set of <a href="macros.html">function-like
macros</a> provides an easy way
to modify or retrieve the state of the control and its components after
the window creation.
